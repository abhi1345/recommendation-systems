# Small-Scale Recommendation System Prototypes
Five different types of recommendation systems used by Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, etc.

The following five types of recommendation systems are implemented, with each in a different script file:
* Popularity-based recommendation: Recommends items based on how 'popular' they are (impersonal).
* Correlation-based recommendation: Recommends items based on Pearson correlation between another from previous user ratings.
* Classification-based collaborative filter: Uses logistic regression to give personalized recommendation.
* Model-based collaborative filter: Build model from user ratings, make recommendations from model.
* Content-based recommendation: Recommends items based on feature similarity. Uses kNN.
